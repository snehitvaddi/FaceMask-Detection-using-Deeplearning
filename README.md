### 😷 FaceMask-Detection-using-Deeplearning
Classification model to classify people with and without masks.
A pilot project of Face mask detection. During the times of COVID-19, covering our face with a mask and maintaining social distancing is essential.  
With advancements in the field of Deep Learning, now we can easily train a model and check if someone is earning a mask or not.
