## 😷FaceMask-Detection-using-Deeplearning
Classification model to classify people with and without masks.
A pilot project of Face mask detection. During the times of COVID-19, covering our face with a mask and maintaining social distancing is essential.  
With advancements in the field of Deep Learning, now we can easily train a model and check if someone is earning a mask or not.

## 📑Dataset: 
Data set can be downloaded from https://github.com/prajnasb/face_detector/tree/master/dataset

## Favour:
It would be highly motivating, if you can STAR⭐ this repo in case you find it helpful it or wanna fork it😅
